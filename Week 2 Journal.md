# Week 1 Journal

### Learning Activities and Resources
This wee, I customised a Joomla CMS website template to make my site look different from the default installation, and read the joomla documentation and studied the LinkedIn Learning course after completing the practical to ensure that I learned everything I needed to know about making a website using the Joomla CMS.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about 1 hour of my own time this week on the subject content which included the LinkedIn Learning Courses.

### Content Insights
Customising the Joomla CMS website template was a good introduction to CMS-based web desgin, as it helped me understand the basics of templates, modules and menus without building a site from scratch. I also learned how to structure pages and add content for a startup website.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to look at the LinkedIn Learning course on wordpress to see if they gave any more insights that I did not learn in the practical work. I learned that using a CMS like Joomla is very different to creating a static website with HTML, and I think developing skills in both approaches will be valuable in the workplace in the future, as many businesses rely on CMS platforms for managing their websites.
