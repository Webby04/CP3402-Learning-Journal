### Estimated Hours
I spent about 1 hour of my own time this week on the subject content which included the LinkedIn Learning Courses.

### Content Insights
This week we participated in group interviews, which showed me that clear communication and active listening are important components in performing good group interviews. We also used  WordPress, which helped me understand a different CMS and see how the content and design are different compared to Joomla.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I learned that good communication and listening to other people's responses is beneficial for future employability. During the interviews, I asked questions such as "How confident are you in matters of web design?", "What role in a group do you feel you are best suited to?", and "How do you feel about disagreements in groups?" These questions helped me better understand my own strengths and preferences. I also found that exploring WordPress improved my technical ability and gave me confidence in working with different CMS platforms.
